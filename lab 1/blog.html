        <h3> Tech Blog</h3>
        <p class = "blog">I’ve been following this site since it started and has seen its progression from just one guy writing about stuff he loves, to a site that get’s decent traffic and has a team of writers.<br>
 <em>Knowtechie</em> is a great example of a site that started out as a hobby but has fast become a business. I like the angle they have as well. <strong> “Tech News For The Non Techie”.</strong> KnowTechie is a blog for people who love tech, but live outside the bubble. This is so refreshing, because so many tech blogs out there are a bit too technical and full to the brim of jargon. It’s nice to see a tech blog that has lowered the entry level to tech news.</p>
